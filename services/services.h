/*******************************************************************************
 * Services - Dynamic tasks to run in FreeRTOS.
 *            Services can be launched at boot or started/suspended/stopped at
 *            any time via 'taskmanager', the base service.
 * 
 *            If a new service is added, a SERVICE_NAME must be defined for it,
 *            and the service implementation and FreeRTOS task launcher must be
 *            created in a separate source file (see "heartbeat_service.c" for
 *            an example). The service's "descriptor" then needs to be added
 *            to the service_descriptors[] array in services.c, which associates
 *            the service's main function pointer with its name string, and
 *            defines whether the service should run at boot.
 * 
 *            The service schedule within FreeRTOS is determined by 3 parameters:
 *            Priority, Repeat, and Delay. Upon any given scheduler tick, the OS
 *            will run the task (service) with the highest priority. After a task
 *            runs, it will check if it should immediately run again based on the
 *            REPEAT parameter; if it has already repeated the specified number
 *            of times it will block itself for the specified number of ticks
 *            based on the DELAY parameter. This essentially means a task's run
 *            percentage (within a priority level) is given by REPEAT/DELAY.
 * 
 *            Pro tip: uncomment add_definitions(-DSCHED_TEST_DELAY) in the
 *            top-level CMakeLists.txt to burn extra cycles in each service, and
 *            then use the 'bin/top' CLI command to show FreeRTOS task runtime
 *            percentages to help tune the scheduler! Don't forget to comment
 *            this back out after testing!
 * 
 *            Note that by default, 1 OS tick is 1 ms.
 *            This can be changed in FreeRTOSConfig.h, see 'configTICK_RATE_HZ'
